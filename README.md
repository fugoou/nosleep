# My boyfriend receives calls every morning. Recently they’ve gotten threatening.
19/11/24

Hi, so um, I don't really know how to start these things, but I thought I would post my story here seeing as most people won't believe me anyway. It all started just over a month ago. 

To paint you a picture, my boyfriend (He pays me.) - let's call him Kingston, was a flattering man. Even if he didn't send me money, I might've still noticed him. That was the thing about Kingston - he grew up rich, the man hadn't touched his door knobs in years. He would flaunt his money left and right. He paid me a small fortune to spend time with him and sleep at his mansion. I felt like a bit of a whore at first, but got used to it fairly quickly. I actually became fond of the man.

He did a lot of odd things with his money. Things I hadn’t heard other rich people doing before. One such thing was having a private FM channel on the radio where he would have voice actors call in every morning as a sort of alarm clock. The voice actors (mostly women) would call in and say something nice about Kingston. Generally complementing his dashing looks, his money and influence or just simply telling him how good he was. It was the most obnoxious thing I had ever seen in my twenty four years. I was still a university student (despite Kingston offering to buy me out) and had never seen anyone do anything like that. The first morning I had woken up in his bed, I thought there was someone else in the room.

 In the beginning I would wander the endless halls of his mansion. It took about a week to finally see every room. I would explore every weird and wonderful room I came across, making a note of which direction I had come from. (It was incredibly easy to get lost.) I would generally act sheepishly in front of the butlers and maids as I stumbled into the most bizarre rooms. I mean seriously, who needs two planetariums? There were enough guest rooms that the building could easily be mistaken for a hotel. My favourite rooms were the aquarium, which had a glass tunnel you could walk through to watch the schools of fish swim over you and a glass floor with a rather creepy looking eel. I also loved the museum. It was filled with all sorts of ancient artifacts that did an awesome job at creeping me out. There were Aztec shields and spears, mediaeval armour sets and statues galore. There was one statue that would always send a shiver down my spine just looking at it. It was a tall man in a cloak. The statue had no hair whatsoever, not even eyebrows. Its pupil-less eyes always seemed to watch me walk around the room. The man stood perfectly upright, and perched on his shoulder was a crow. Kingston had plaques made for every artifact with a short description of what it was and what time period it was from. For this statue however, there was no time period. All the Plaque read was:

“The man for whom the crows follow.”

It is believed that the culture of this statue's origin believed it to be some sort of reaper, or omen of death.

Date: unknown.

I loved all the mysteries that the mansion had to offer, I even started to get used to that narcissistic excuse for an alarm clock. However it wasn't long before the voices started to change.

One morning I woke up to heavy breathing. It sounded like a broken car trying to start. It was dry, heavy and rough. In my semi-conscious state I believed it to be Kingston sleeping. As I rolled over to tell him to be quiet, my arm missed his chest and landed on the warm bed sheets. He was already sitting up. Kingston looked quizzically at the radio from which the breathing was emanating. He got out of bed in search of one of his servants. (He didn't like it when things didn't go his way.) I heard him sternly telling some poor servant to get the voice actor on the phone. So that was my morning.

Later on at lunch, a servant (Let's call him Alfred - I used to read a lot of comics.) brought Kingston a message saying that the voice actor wouldn't answer her phone. Instead of acting worried, Kingston just waved Alfred away and told him to get a replacement voice. I was a little shocked at the whole ordeal, but continued eating without a word. Best not to bother Kingston when he’s grumpy. During the evening, the news came on, they were talking about a recent murder not far from where we lived. And lo and behold, there was Kingston's voice actor. She looked pretty. I could see why she got the part. Furious with the news, Kingston immediately contacted the police.

21/10/24

The following day a couple of officers arrived at the mansion to talk with Kingston and ask some questions. I remember one of them remarking that: 

“This place is freakin’ wicked.” a little out of left field for a police officer, I thought. The officers sat down with us and asked the usual questions you'd hear in the movies. They were perplexed with Kingston’s alarm clock situation. I couldn't really answer much as I didn't know the woman, but Kingston answered the questions very apathetically. Once the officers had finished taking notes, Kingston sat forward and clasped his hands together, making eye contact with the officers for the first time since we sat down.

“How did Thaliea die?”

The lead police officer sighed and looked towards the ground.

“Violently.”

“How, specifically?” I wasn't sure I wanted to hear the answer but I stayed by Kingston all the same.

“It is believed that the killer placed A heated metal ball into her mouth before taping it shut. The killer displayed her body on a makeshift crucifix. Our detectives believe she was martyred as some kind of warning.”

“Fuck.” Kingston sat wide eyed. I felt ill. 

“It seems fairly obvious that this was some sort of religious killing, but we don't know why or how Thaliea was chosen.”

We continued to receive calls over the next few weeks. It was usually about 2-3 a week and always the same, dry raspy breathing way too close to the microphone. It was like the stranger was just trying to be there. Make himself known. I’m not ashamed to admit this, but since the calls started I had become afraid of the dark again. It never felt like I was alone. Each alarm recording was taken as evidence to the police and was of no help whatsoever. 

One morning when I woke up, the sound echoing around the room was extraordinarily loud. Kingston’s top tier audio system made it feel like the source of the sound was in the room with you. It always made me shiver no matter the voice, but this was worse - much worse. The voice was dry and raspy like the owner spoke with a neck stoma. He said, 

“When I come, will you let me in?” There was the start of a muffled scream as the phone cut off. I didn’t know how to react to what I had just heard, so I did the only reasonable thing I could think of - I pulled my knees into my chest and started to cry. Kingston wasn't much consolation either. He sat upright in bed and swore - a lot.

After the two of us had calmed down a little, I told Kingston that I was leaving for my parents. I couldn't stand waking up to any other messages or hearing about any more deaths. I told Kingston that I would come back when this was all over. He grabbed my wrist, not in an aggressive way, (although his grip was tight enough that it hurt a little.) but when I looked into his eyes I could see a desperation in them. He was already sweating profusely - he must've been having a bad dream before, possibly about the murder. I desperately wanted to leave, but seeing him like this, I couldn't. I couldn't leave him to deal with all of this by himself. Against my better judgement I decided to stay.

19/11/24

A few days had passed with nothing out of the ordinary happening, but Kingston was still on edge. He was paranoid about everything. He slept with the lights on now. He told me he felt like the shadows weren't shadows. Whatever that meant. Within a day he had hired an entire security team to keep 24 hour surveillance around his mansion. He vowed to keep both of us safe, no matter how much it cost. I had never realised it until now, but I was starting to catch feelings for him. Besides his money and looks, I actually cared for the man.

We were sitting in the living room when there was a call from security telling us that the police were at the main gate. It was the same officers from before. (They were still just as impressed with the mansion's size.) Before letting the officers in, Kingston discreetly told me not to mention the last alarm we had received. 

“They just don't need to know about it, okay?” He had said. We sat with the officers and they told us what we had expected since their arrival - Someone else was dead. Another of Kingston’s voice actors went missing about five days ago. Her body was found this morning. It was in the same state as the last. The officers said that if the post mortem is similar to the last, it will find that she was alive throughout the entire process. 

“A horrible way to go.” Said the sergeant. It was at that moment that I thought back to the scream just before the alarm shut off. I completely broke down and told the police everything about that morning. Kingston shot me a slightly annoyed look which let me know there would be a conversation later. The officers looked at each other simultaneously and brought out their notepads. After a couple of hours they finished up and left. I turned to Kingston after closing the door. He stood in the foyer livid. 

“Why would you tell them that? After I specifically told you not to!”

“It was the right thing to do, why wouldn't you want me to tell them? For christ sake another woman is dead!” Kingston had developed an infatuation with solving this case himself. (He never liked or trusted the police, which I thought to be stupid.) Despite how ludicrous I found the idea, I never challenged it. 

22/11/24

Kingston’s been up for the last few days, barely an hour of sleep in between. I've been helping him set up a super improvised pin board with notes and photos cluttered around. It looked like something out of a movie where a retired detective is helping out on the case of his life, bar the string between photos and notes. (Although I would like to see that added.) Both of us are incredibly tired now. I’d like to get some sleep but Kingston insists all the lights stay on.

29/11/24

A week has passed now. The pin board has grown. There have been two more murders and a missing woman. All the same way. No more messages have been left to us, but the last two voice actors have been taken into protective custody. We not only have our security team providing 24 hour surveillance around the mansion, but now the police too. I guess it does pay to be rich. 

Since Kingston’s remaining voice actors were taken into protective custody, we had just gotten used to a long lie in until this morning when we were awoken by another alarm. This time it started off normal. A woman's voice came over the radio, which at first I didn't realise was wrong. I listened to her say the usual things to Kingston.

“Time to wake up. You've got a big day ahead of you! Her voice cracked at the end of the last line. She began to sob.

“Not long to wait now,” I could hear her voice tremble. “He'll be there soon. When he arrives will you let him in? Will you worship him? Will you present him with the gift of your flesh? I know -” she started crying. 

A similar dry voice could be heard in the background.

“Finish the line Bethany. It's alright.” He sounded relaxed like he was trying to soothe her, despite his coarse voice. 

“I know I will.” Screaming echoed around the room and through my head before the alarm cut off. My head was spinning. I stumbled towards the ensuite but didn't make it in time. I vomited all over the floor. Kingston sat in bed still, unfazed by my collapse, staring at the wall in anger. I noticed his hand slowly come out from under his pillow.

06/12/24

It’s been a week since the last call. Kingston has been adamant to remove our police protection. He insisted that his security team were the best of the best. The law really did make him uncomfortable. I don't know how Kingston made all of his money, but I'm willing to bet that not all of it was legal. Every night when we go to bed, Kingston has been sitting in our room taking notes, and playing the recordings of each alarm. The last thing I would hear before bed each night was:

“When I come, will you let me in?” *Click!*

“When I come, will you let me in?” *Click!*

“When I come, will you let me in?” *Click!*

It drove me crazy. Kingston continued this every night for a little over a week. Kingston was obsessed with trying to decipher that damn riddle. I never realised how tensed up I always was until a few moments before I would fall asleep. In those short few moments, I knew bliss. My body would uncoil like a spring loosening. It would feel as though a heavy weight I had forgotten I was carrying had been lifted from my body. That's what I would look forward to most all day, every day.

One night, I was lying in bed and was awoken by the usual *Click!* of the recorder playing.

“When I come, will you let me in?”

I finally decided to say something. I rolled over to face Kingston’s desk in order to give him a piece of my mind. When I turned however, my arm pressed against his sleeping body. My eyes widened and my throat closed. I had finally found out that my fight or flight response was more akin to that of a deer in headlights. I lay for what felt like minutes convincing myself into thinking I was just on edge. It seemed to be working, until I heard the *Click!* of the recorder stopping. I felt fear like no other. I was angry at Kingston, how could he not be awake? I wished to wake him up more than anything. I hoped that somehow if I wanted it enough he would sense the fact and wake up, but nothing happened. My gut wrenched when I felt the bed behind me start to sink. Someone was climbing on. In what I assumed were my last moments, all I could muster was a defeated whimper. I felt a warm breath on the back of my neck and the foulest smell imaginable, like rotting fish. The breath crept up my neck, tickling each hair on the way, and into my ear. It prickled the inside of my ear canal. I could only grip the covers tighter. In that damned dry and raspy voice came words that will haunt me until the end of my days.

“I’m here now.” At that, Kingston jolted up, his hand coming out from underneath his pillow. There were three flashes of light and deafening bangs before the breaths stopped and a muffled thump came from behind me. Kingston switched on his side table lamp and got out of bed, keeping his gun pointed behind me. I still lay frozen, now staring at the empty space Kingston had just been laying. It was clear I wasn't thinking straight, because despite everything I wanted him back in that spot more than anything.

Kingston tried to speak to me but every word was a mumble. My ears were numb. I think he was celebrating the kill. I noticed that life was starting to return to my body, even if it was only trembling. There was a thud behind me and one more flash and bang. The room lit up once more and I knew something was very wrong. Kingston’s victory monologue stopped. I felt the breath return to my ear, and I froze up once more.

“Don't be troubled. It is time.” A pain hit the back of my head and I saw spots before they faded to black.

I awoke tied to a chair and with my mouth gagged. It was hard to concentrate on anything at first, but I came to realise that we were in the museum. Statues and Aztec masks never looked so fear-inducing. This was the first time I got a look at the source of our paranoia. He wasn’t a million miles away from what I thought he would look like. He was bald, with no eyebrows or eyelashes. His skin, riddled with cuts. Each cut was precisely placed like they meant something. His body was a canvas for carnage. He wore only torn cargo pants and was covered in dirt and grime. He appeared as though he had been crawling through a dumpster or a sewer. Some of his open wounds were infected and swollen. They had turned purple and leaked yellow pus. He had three bullet hole scars on his torso, all of which looked old, but that was impossible. There was still wet blood staining his chest and belly and it definitely wasn't ours.

“At last I have the honour of gazing upon you,” He said. “I have been waiting for this moment-” He stopped. His entire body shook and his face lit up for a second. The man regained his composure and continued, 

“For so long.” Kingston was tied to a chair next to me, but the man wasn't looking at either of us. He was looking *over* us. I turned my head the best I could to find the source of his interest. We were sitting at the base of a statue.

The imposing figure stood perfectly upright with a crow resting on his shoulder. For some reason looking at the statue made my panic worse. Despite being made of stone, it always felt as though it had some sort of authority. It's hard to explain. Contrary to earlier on, I had never wanted to talk so much. With a cloth gag cutting into the sides of my mouth, I couldn’t manage more than muffled screams.

“There is no point calling for anyone my sweet. Nobody will come. The only one that is here for you forever and always is my master. Be not afraid, for soon we will all be united in his blessed presence.” He spoke calmly like he was trying to convince us to go along with it. The cuts underneath his eyes seemed to smile as he did. He walked over to Kingston and bowed. 

“You will make a good offering. The blood of the keeper, and the blood of the loyalist.” Kingston tried to rock his chair but the man grasped his shoulder and held him still. All of the fire had left his eyes. He looked terrified. At this point I was crying, Kingston was too. The man turned around and unfolded a leather toolkit, with scalpels, a blowtorch, coal tongs and a metal ball. 

“He will rise once more. He who has gifted me cures to my ailments, He who has bestowed much insight. He has been with me every step of the way. A guiding embrace, A fire on the cold nights, A shadow cast on the wall. He is glorious is he not?” The man fired up his blowtorch and clasped the metal ball in the prongs. Kingston had gone limp. He looked catatonic. I was doing my very best to pull my hands free from the rope, but couldn't manage it. My wrists felt hot. I felt blood run down the palm of my hands and drip off my fingertips. Our torturer turned around, holding a glowing orange ball in the tongs.

He approached Kingston who was still unresponsive. He used his free hand to remove Kingston’s gag. As he pulled it out of his mouth, Kingston jerked his head forward and crunched down on the man's finger. The scarred man howled and recoiled, pulling his hand from Kingston’s face, one finger shy. Kingston spat out a wad of blood and a finger with two teeth attached. He tilted his head back and smiled a bloody smile. The scarred man stared at his finger and slowly composed himself. I could tell he was struggling. He marched over to Kingston and pressed the ball into his cheek ferociously. I could hear Kingston’s flesh sizzle louder than his screams. The ball melted through his cheek and into his mouth. That lunatic let the ball drop into his mouth. He kept Kingston’s head tilted back. All I could hear was the scream piercing through my concussed head. It was short lived though, as Kingston’s vocal chords must’ve given out, or been melted away. He went limp a couple of seconds after.

The man took his scalpel and cut open Kingston’s lifeless belly. Delicately, he collected the blood in a bowl. I couldn't watch anymore. I don't know where it came from, I’ll probably never experience it again, but a sudden wave of adrenaline surged my body. I used my toes to push the chair back, toppling it over. The antique chair shattered and I felt two of my fingers fold the wrong way, but the adrenaline sheltered me from the pain. My hands were still tied to loose pieces of wood, but now I could move. I used all my effort to rise to my feet and make a dash for the door. My head was spinning. I could make out three blurry doors waving in my vision. I reached out and felt the handle. Throwing the door off its hinges, I bolted from the museum and down the corridor. Unfortunately, I noticed something I wished I hadn’t. Nobody was chasing me.

What I did next, I can't really explain. Maybe it was some human urge. Maybe it was curiosity or over confidence. I decided to go back to the room. Something was compelling me, calling me to the room. I knew it was a stupid thing to do, there were alarm bells ringing in my head like crazy, and yet, I approached the museum all the same. The pain in my fingers was starting to return. I crept towards the museum door on the balls of my feet, ready to run.

I leaned around the door, and saw that the man was still standing with Kingston, about 50 ft from the door. He was using his blood to paint marks on himself, Kingston’s corpse and the statue. The marks were strange, I had never seen symbols like them before. He didn't look as though he had even noticed my escape. Finishing his work, the scarred man stepped back to admire his painting. Taking his scalpel, he slit the palms of his hands and wiped them down his cheeks and neck. He said something strange that I couldn't make out. A wave of depression washed over my body. I had no idea why. I felt as though there was no point in anything. A deep sadness consumed me. I didn't care if I died at that moment even though I knew I should. The lamps around the room seemed to get dimmer, as if the shadows wrestled the light into submission. Colour seemed to leave the room, like there would never be happiness again. My breath floated out in front of me and every hair on my body stood up at once. Whatever was happening I knew I had to see it. Even if it cost me my life. 



With a loud cracking sound the statue stepped off its podium. Standing at 7ft tall It was no longer made of stone, although it was still the same shade of dark grey. The crow looked around the room and squawked. The scarred man fell to his knees, hands extended, creating a bowl. He cried tears of joy. The used-to-be statue took two lumbering steps towards him and rested his hand on the side of the man's face caressing it. In a flash, his large hand clamped shut, crushing half of the man's skull in his hand. The perched crow hopped off his shoulder and pecked away at the body, dragging the reluctant eye out of its socket. The statue turned towards the other doors and pushed them off their hinges with ease, leaving.

It's been a few days since my last post. Since then, I no longer feel that depression, it's been slowly fading, however the world still seems a slightly darker place now. My fingers are healing, I had a total of ten stitches for my concussion and I am struggling to type, so I’ll keep this post short. Kingston’s funeral is next Tuesday. Life is going to be very different without him. I have left California and am staying with my parents in Louisiana. The police didn't know what to make of the situation and obviously didn't believe my story. To anyone reading this, please be careful. I don't know what that thing is and what it's capable of but it's out there somewhere. If you notice a murder of crows, take my warning and look over your shoulder regularly.
