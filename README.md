# Someone keeps knocking on my window. I live on the fourth floor.
Normally I wouldn’t reach out here but I don’t know where else to post this. A few days ago someone started knocking on my windows. The problem is that I live on the fourth floor. On Monday we finished the proceedings for the passing of my Grandmother. That day was filled with the standard apologies for loss from family and friends but I didn’t know what to say. I was never close with her in my adult life and this honestly felt like an unexpected blow. I figured maybe we would have had more time to make things up but I woke up one day and boom that’s it. I still had so much I wanted to say and it had been years since we spoke. Even longer since I had a conversation sober. I quit the bottle but was still too scared to reach out and now I figured I would have to live with it forever. 

Monday night she spoke to me with a wispy breath.

“I’m here.”

I froze. The lights were off and I was half awake but I swear I heard it clear as day. My grandmother’s voice, dim and quiet but with a strong rasp.

I slowly slipped out of bed and went to the window. I live on the fourth floor, it’s not like someone could have been messing with me but I swear it came from outside.

“Let me in.”

Again it flowed through the closed window like a breeze. My blood ran cold. I knew logically it couldn’t be her, we buried her. I watched it happen. But she’s talking to me right now. 

I ran to the window after turning on my light and saw nothing. Just the same skyline view as always. I looked down and could even see a single neighbor walking on the sidewalk. 

I figured I must have started to lose it at this point. Maybe I’m so upset with her passing I’m imagining things. Maybe I’m just that exhausted from the last several days of setting up arrangements for the funeral. 

I wake up and life continues as normal. I work my job, come home to my studio apartment and get ready to unwind. Turn on the TV and white noise fills the modest space. As night approaches I ready myself slightly fearful for the daylight to end. I decided I should take a melatonin to sleep and get through this as quickly as possible. 

I woke up at 2:15 am to the sound of a woman crying. It was loud, ear piercing screaming of pain. I bolted from my bed scrambling to find the culprit of this unexpected cacophony. I look out the window in the dark and see a reflection of a shadow screaming. As soon as I lay eyes on it, the figure and sound disappear. 

“Please it’s so cold, let me in”

Her voice again. It’s different but it’s her voice. Scratchier than ever, she sounds sickly. I heard she died quickly from the accident but this sounds like agony. I reached to the window to feel where the shadow was.  

My windows don’t open. They’re sealed shut and never had any opportunity to open in the first place. This apartment was an old hospital prior to a renovation and had been sealed for decades. 

“Grandma, I hear you.” I whispered back, still not quite believing what I was hearing. 

“Please dear, let me in.” she whispered back.

“Grandma, I can't look at the window, they’re sealed shut.”

I wanted this to be real so badly. I hadn’t had time to talk to her sober in so long, I wanted her to see that now but I missed my chance. Not this time, not again.

“Grandma please, I am so sorry. I”

My words were cut off by a sudden shriek and the sound of something hitting the ground four stories down. I was so taken aback I just froze in place. I tried to look down but couldn’t see where anything landed. 

“Grandma? Are you there?” 

Nothing. Absolute silence overtook the space again.

The next day I went by where I heard something fall but saw nothing. No bird, nothing. Usually if I hear a big bang I just assume it’s a bird that wasn’t paying attention but no this was a distinctively loud noise of something splattering. 

Work was difficult that day, I could barely keep my eyes open after the night I had. I shuffled through the day like a zombie and managed to make it home eventually. As soon as I got settled in I slept with no intention of waking until the early hours of the day. 

BANG

I look out the window to see a shadow staring at me. Just the head and fingers are visible as if it is just creeping over the window. After staring for a moment it doesn’t move. I had expected it to dart off again into the night like last time. I walk to the window and hear a muttering. 

“I know you can hear me won’t you please let me in? I’ve missed you so much. I wish you were dead instead of me.”

My heart dropped. I didn’t know what to say. I had thought the same thing when I had heard the news in my darkest moments but to hear it said in her voice shook me to the core.

“You know I never wanted you. Let me in and we can finally be close again.”

This didn’t sound like my grandmother. She may have been strict and uptight but she would never say such awful things. I looked down and noticed a window opener. A small device I could open this sealed window with that had never been there. I stared at it and my arms moved intrinsically. I hadn’t started intentionally moving my hands but I could feel them wrap around the knob and begin to twist. With a rush I quickly fought to regain will over my body’s movement. 

“No please this isn’t real this isn’t real this isn’t real.”

I started shaking as my hands went back to my sides as I felt a slight breeze coming into my stagnant apartment. Fresh spring air. I looked to see the edges just barely open. The air has gotten bitter. I tried to leave but my door doesn’t have a lock or handle anymore. 

I yelled, hoping to get the attention of my neighbors screaming to the high heavens begging for someone to come inside my apartment. That was three days ago. I’ve begun to run out of food and every night she has asked to come inside. Tonight I’m going to let her but I needed to reach out here first. If you don’t hear from me again, please, someone come check 417 at the Flats.
