# The Little People Are Real, and They Took My Sister and My Brother (Part 1)
[Part One: The Day She Vanished]


I’m not going to name the reservation. I don’t want this to become a headline. If you know, you know. If you’ve ever lived in a place like mine, you’ve probably already heard some version of this story.

But this one’s mine. So I’ll tell it.

I grew up in a small town tucked between mountains that feel older than the sky. The kind of place where you know every dog’s name before you know their owner. Because everyone around you is either known as Uncle, Aunt, or Cousin. A tight-knit community where everyone is family. The kind of place where no one would lock their doors unless they had a reason to… and unfortunately… there’s always a reason.

I was raised by my grandmother, along with my two cousins. Technically second cousins, but that didn’t matter. We were siblings in everything but blood. We shared a room. We shared chores. We shared every scar and every lie we told, every butt-whooping, every grounding.

My older cousin, who I’ll call “T,” was quiet even as a kid. Smarter than me. Stronger, too. The kind of kid who listened when our elders told stories instead of wandering off. I didn’t. I rolled my eyes. I cracked jokes. I was always the one daring someone to do something they shouldn’t. Though I was usually the one doing said dare. Causing trouble, running amok. And there’d be “T” standing right beside me. Not because he was secretly a troublemaker too. But because he always looked out for us. He always made sure we got home safe. He never partook in our schemes—he’d watch and laugh, pick us up if we fell, carry us when we were too tired. And stand beside us and take every whooping that came with terrorizing the neighborhood. He was a good brother.

And then there was S.

Our little cousin. Our baby sister, really. I don’t even want to use a fake name for her. It feels wrong. She had this chipped front tooth and the kind of laugh that made even the angry dogs in the street stop growling. She was fearless in that soft way little kids can be—brave because she didn’t know not to be yet.

You wouldn’t believe this tiny ball of Indigenous fury could hold her own with us big kids. Though me and “T” were 13 and 15 respectively, “S” was only 10 years old. Maybe it was the need to prove herself, or maybe it was genuine youthful spirit, but she stood right beside us, causing mayhem and mischief every step of the way.

She had a bit of a crush on one of the other neighborhood boys I’ll call “J.” S, J, and I would dare each other to do the dumbest things, usually with T following us like a shadow. Whether it was jumping into the nearby river with no clothes on or running down the street shooting fireworks at nearby houses—those were good times.

The three of us were raised like siblings. Grandma made sure of that. She fed us the same food. Yelled at us the same way. Loved us all the same—loud, gruff, and without explanation. But if we needed it—if we needed her—she was there. Always.

During our youthful days, we had a spot we weren’t supposed to go. Everyone knew about it, even if nobody talked about it out loud. Just past the southern ridge, tucked at the bottom of a nearby mountain and a thicket of moss-covered stone, was a mouth in the rock. A cave, unmarked on any official map. It breathed cold even in July. Birds wouldn’t nest near it. Dogs wouldn’t go close.

The adults told us never to go there. The stories were older than them, passed down with tired eyes and slow voices. Every tribe around here had some version of the same thing.

The Little People.

Not fairy tale creatures. Not helpful forest gnomes. These weren’t things you could put in cartoons.

T believed those stories. S wanted to. I didn’t.

I still don’t.

But I believed in games. I was pretty competitive—like S, desperate to prove myself. And one summer afternoon, we dared each other.

Each of us had our own paths into the cave, our own “secret trail” that we swore was the fastest. All the kids did. At the end of all paths, deep into the mountain, was a hollow chamber named Brave Woman’s Grave. One of us, long ago, gave it that name, saying the rock in the center looked like a bed for the dead. The name stuck.

We decided to race.

This wasn’t unusual—we’d done it before. All the kids did, and probably a lot of the adults too, when they were younger. T also did so when he was younger, before he got so stiff. He even claimed he was the fastest to ever do it. I couldn’t let that claim slide. I had a big head for the little snot-nosed brat I was.

God, I wish I never uttered those words.

The rules were simple: no flashlights, no cheating, and the first one to reach the Grave had to put both hands on the slab and say,
“Here lies the Queen of Bones.”

Stupid, childish fun. It was tradition. At least among the youth.

But before we even reached the cave, something stopped me.

We’d just crossed the river when I looked left and saw someone standing just off the bank.

Not swimming. Not moving.

It looked like a man in plain clothes.

Just standing. Facing the trail. Still as beached driftwood.

He wasn’t anyone I knew. Not from school. Not from town. Not from the rez.

S called for me, and I turned in her direction—to see her and T waiting for me near the mouth of the cave. As I started to speak, I looked back toward the river.

The man was gone.

No splash. No movement. Just gone.

I told myself it must’ve been a log. Or a trick of the light, since it was evening and the shadows were casting long. Or maybe even that my eyes were playing games because I wanted the cave to feel scary.

I ran faster after that.

At the mouth of the cave, I stood beside my siblings. T was snickering, saying things like, “Get ready to eat my dust.” And S replying with words and names a 10-year-old shouldn’t know—but she did. We all laughed at her vulgarness.

And then—
we lined up, side by side, like always.

Just… for the last time.

“1… 2… 3…”

My trail into the Grave curved through a narrow passage that dropped down a six-foot stone chute. The only way back up was to press your feet against one wall, your shoulders against the other, and shimmy until your ribs ached. I liked it. It made me feel like the cave didn’t want me there—and I beat it anyway.

I made it first.

It was easy getting there and easy getting back because years of exploring youths had left many chalk markings indicating certain paths to and from the Grave. Even on your own “secret trail” it was easy to find these markings. So rarely, if at all, did anyone actually get lost.

My voice echoed when I called it out:
“Here lies the Queen of Bones!”

No one answered.

I waited, sitting on the stone slab in the middle of the hollow. The Grave was always cold—colder than the rest of the cave. It smelled like dust and rust and something older. Something damp.

Then I heard it.

Not footsteps, but a scraping sound. A shuffle of pebbles. Then silence.

I called out, thinking it was T.

No reply.

Then more sounds. Scratching. A fast skittering noise overhead, like nails dragging across stone. I looked up… nothing.

The Grave echoed everything. I heard a breath I didn’t think was mine. I felt watched. I felt a sense of dread I’d never felt at that time in my life.

Memories of those scary stories from years earlier. The folktales the elders would share late into the nights of powwows and ceremonies.

Stories of those small demons known as Nimerigar—or The Little People.

They were old, wild, and cruel—small only in stature, not in strength. They’d mimic voices, slip into your dreams, steal children and leave behind strange carvings in the dirt. They’d crawl on the ceilings and whisper from holes in the walls. They lived under the mountains and knew the caves better than light ever could.

These small cave-dwellers who would come out of their underground homes to grab children, like us, who strayed too far into the woods and mountains, dragging them deep into tunnels much too small for their bodies to fit completely—but they’d pull them anyway.

Leaving behind only what couldn’t.

My heart started racing twice as fast as I looked all around. The cracks in the roof letting in the last dying embers of sunlight. Just enough for me to see shapes and shadows. But the dark around me grew slowly more suffocating as the noises grew louder.

And then I saw it.

A blur of movement—low and fast—darting between two rocks.

I thought I saw fingers. A face. A grin stretched too wide.

“It’s them… It’s really them…” I thought, as despair gripped my throat, strangling out the last bit of air in my lungs.

“This is it… why didn’t I listen…”

…Is what I would have thought, if said blur didn’t stop in the middle of the last, dwindling sunlight in the cave.

For just a second, I believed it. I felt every story we’d ever been told crack open inside my chest like a broken levee. A harsh, unforgiving wave of hindsight overwhelming me. Drowning me in an ocean of if onlys.

Then it barked.

A coyote. Scrawny. Half-blind. Fur matted and stomach hollow.
Probably more terrified than I was just a moment ago.

I coughed out a dry laugh at the realization, the abrupt sound scaring off the little mutt.

It slipped through a narrow gap behind the altar and vanished.

I exhaled heavily again—this time so hard I coughed up a fit.

“Jesus,” I whispered. “I almost believed it.”

I stood and climbed out, away from the Grave, scraping my back on the way up, and followed the white chalk marks back toward the surface.

When I got to the cave’s mouth, T was already there.

He grinned. “Took you long enough.”

“Get outta here,” I said. “I was waiting for you!”

We threw jabs. Elbowed each other. Talked trash the way cousins do when neither of them wants to admit they were scared.

Then we waited.

We waited longer.

S didn’t come out.

At first, we joked. Said she probably got turned around or stopped to dig the cobwebs out of her braids. We stood at the mouth of the cave, peering in.

She wasn’t there.

We waited.

The sun dipped lower.

We waited more.

We called her name.

We yelled louder.

Then we started running.

We told the adults.

The adults called everyone else.

The uncles. The cousins. The old aunties who never left their porches. Even the medicine woman came.

Then the cops.

They brought flashlights and dogs and men with radios who didn’t bother hiding their annoyance.

They found her shoe tucked just inside the cave’s entrance. A trail of footprints, half-erased by time and shifting stone. Another shoe farther in.

Then nothing.

I told one of the officers I saw a man at the river. But he looked at me like I’d told him it was Bigfoot. Then he scribbled something in a notebook and never asked again.

The other officers said things like she must’ve wandered off. Or fallen. Or gotten scared and hidden.

The tribal search parties kept looking for two weeks.
The police stopped after three days.

She was never found.
