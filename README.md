# I Signed a Contract to Study Viruses. I Think I Doomed Us All
I know this sounds insane, but it’s real. I don’t care if you believe me. I need to get this out before it’s too late. I fear my time is running out, and I need to get this off my chest.

My name is Alexander. I’m a virologist working for a company I won’t disclose. About a year ago, I was approached by a man in a suit far more expensive than anything I could afford.

He told me he had come across some research papers I had released online — field data and early virology reports from my time abroad. He said he was impressed by my work and wanted to offer me a job.

I was skeptical at first. I asked him what this would all be about — what I would be doing, and most importantly, what the pay would be. He presented a figure written down on a contract he had already written up for me. Strange, I thought — but once I saw the pay, I signed immediately.

The contract was vague. No company name, no official header — just a title: *Consultant, Level 3 – Pathogen Analysis*. Beneath that, broad terms: relocation, discretion, and full cooperation.

Within a week, I was flown to a facility in Central Africa — though I was never told the exact location. The plane windows were blacked out from the inside, and we landed on an unmarked airstrip. From there, a convoy drove me for hours through dense bushland until we arrived at a remote compound surrounded by electrified fencing and guarded by men who never spoke.

Inside, the facility was cold, clinical, and silent. No signs, no names on the lab doors. Just numbers. I was assigned to *Lab 6B*. They took me to the living quarters and I was told to remain here until the entire team was brought in.

I sat in silence for a while, trying to piece together what exactly we were meant to be doing in such a remote, heavily guarded facility. There was something deeply unsettling about the place — the walls were a blinding white, the air sterile, and the room stripped down to only the bare essentials: a bed, a metal desk, and a sink.

But it was the silence that got to me. There were no intercoms, no background noise, no idle conversation from staff — just the constant hum of fluorescent lights overhead and the occasional buzz of the security gate beyond my door. It felt less like a research facility and more like a waiting room for something unknown.

Eventually, with no instructions and nothing else to do, I lay back on the narrow bed and drifted into a restless sleep.

The next morning, the man who had brought me to the room knocked before entering. He told me the rest of the team had arrived, and it was time to debrief everyone on what we would be doing.

I was led from the room into a long corridor, lined with bright red LEDs that cast an ominous glow along the walls. After a short walk, we entered a large conference room.

The tension in the air was immediate and heavy. You could practically see the confusion on everyone’s faces.

The man in the suit stood at the front of the room, hands clasped behind his back. Two others — one in a lab coat, the other in a dark uniform — stood off to the side, saying nothing.

“Good morning,” he began. “You’ve all been selected to participate in a high-priority project under the directions from the Overseer. From this point forward, you will report directly to the Overseer. Your specializations were not chosen at random.”

He clicked a remote, and a blank screen flickered to life behind him. A logo appeared — minimalist, unfamiliar — followed by the words: *Project Cerberus – Level 3 Clearance Required*\*\*.\*\*

“Your assignments will be distributed individually,” he continued. “There will be no cross-lab communication unless authorized. For now, you’ll be oriented on safety protocols, containment procedures, and reporting structures.”

A pause. He looked around the room, as if measuring us.

“You are not here to ask questions. You are here to follow procedure.”

No one spoke. But the tension in the room had sharpened — quiet, careful, and waiting. We were then escorted back to our quarters with the promise of a full day's work tomorrow.

The next morning we awoke at 5AM, the Overseer speaking over an intercom system I had since believed to be non-existent. Security personnel met us at our quarters, each person who I saw was being escorted to their stations.

I arrived at my station about 10 minutes after leaving my quarters. I was met by a group of 3 others who were also being escorted to the same laboratory. The security officers stepped aside and let us enter the lab, sealing the door behind us.

We took a couple minutes to introduce ourselves. Dr. Lance and Mrs. Alice were the names of my new co-workers. The intercom system for this laboratory turned on, giving us instructions to approach the containment room.

Stepping inside we acknowledged the presence of a purification zone that we needed to pass through before entering the storage cell.

We moved through the purification zone — a full-body air shower, followed by a UV scan and a brief chemical misting. No one explained why such intense sterilization was necessary, but no one questioned it either

Beyond it was the storage cell: a temperature-controlled vault lined with reinforced cases, each labeled with a simple code — *X-24*, followed by a series of digits.

One of the cases had already been moved to the prep station. A set of vials sat on a stainless steel tray, next to a sealed report folder marked *RESTRICTED – HANDLING PROTOCOL ONLY*.

Dr. Lance opened it. Inside were basic instructions — gene sequencing protocol, tissue culture guidelines, PPE requirements — but no information on what we were actually working with. No origin, no species, no viral family.

“This is a ghost file,” he muttered. “It’s like they’ve scrubbed everything but the procedures.”

We began our tasks anyway. I handled the sequencing while Alice prepared the samples under the biosafety hood. At first glance, the blood sample showed high viral load — far higher than anything we’d normally work with outside of a BSL-4 facility.

As the sequencing machine began its run, a low hum filled the room. I watched the screen, where the nucleotides began populating line by line — A, T, C, G — the genetic alphabet unfolding like a riddle.

Alice glanced up from the hood. “It’s almost... too clean, isn’t it? No sign of degradation. Like it was *just* drawn.”

I nodded. “Either it was preserved in cryo right away... or it’s still active.”

Dr. Lance was already cross-referencing the emerging sequences with known viral databases. After a few minutes, his brow furrowed.

“Nothing matches. Not even partials. I’ve run it against SARS-CoV-2, Marburg, Nipah, even synthetic virus registries. This thing… *it’s not in any public or classified archive*.”

I turned to him. “Could it be a chimera?”

He hesitated. “Maybe. But it doesn’t follow any known recombination pattern. This sequence — it’s *designed*… like someone reverse-engineered evolution.”

Suddenly, Alice stepped back from the hood, her glove dripping red.

“I— I nicked myself,” she said, voice tight. “Scalpel slipped.”

The room went still.

Dr. Lance didn’t move. “Seal the hood. Immediate decon. And you—” he pointed to the emergency intercom, “—call the Overseer. We have a possible exposure.”

I secured the tray while alarms began to flash silently in red. A faint hiss followed — the negative pressure system sealing the lab.

Alice sat in isolation now — sealed in the decon chamber behind a reinforced observation pane, her gloved hands twitching slightly. She insisted she felt fine, but we’d already noted the tremor. Dr. Lance kept a quiet log of every symptom, no matter how minor. That’s how you track new pathogens.

Meanwhile, I continued the sequence assembly. The read depth was exceptional — no noise, no errors. But the gene order made no evolutionary sense. There were *synthetic signatures* scattered throughout — short tandem repeats, spliced regulatory elements, even embedded CRISPR arrays. It was a *virus built from borrowed blueprints*, stitched with purpose.

“Pulling the ORFs now,” I said.

Dr. Lance leaned over. “Any clues on capsid proteins? Anything we can run against monoclonals?”

I shook my head. “No structural homology to anything viral — or even *alive*. It’s... modular. Like it’s waiting to assemble based on its environment.”

He stared at the screen. “Adaptive coding… But that's not possible at this scale.”

Alice’s condition began to shift subtly. Her voice was still steady, but the fine movements of her left hand were increasingly erratic — she fumbled a water bottle and misjudged its grip.

“Muscle fatigue,” she said. “Probably just adrenaline crash.”

But the biometric monitor said otherwise: her EMG spikes were *asynchronous*. Neurons were misfiring — not fatigue. Something was interfering with motor control.

Dr. Lance didn’t say a word. He was busy mapping a protein from the viral genome. It had an unusually long folded domain, flanked by glycosylation sites — similar to prion-like motifs seen in *tauopathies*.

“You seeing this?” he said, voice low. “This protein targets microtubules. It can hijack axonal transport.”

I stared at the chart. “You're saying it’s *reprogramming her nervous system*?”

“No. Worse.” He paused. “It’s using it. Like scaffolding.”

Alice’s left hand now hung limply, but her right remained functional. She was still lucid, tracking the conversation, fully aware — and terrified. Her body was slowly betraying her, neuron by neuron. I tried to reassure her, but behind her, on the monitor, the virus’s RNA replication rate showed a secondary surge — *it had entered a new phase*.

Alice slumped slightly in her seat, as though finally giving in to exhaustion. But her right leg began to spasm in low, arrhythmic jerks. Then it stopped. Her eyes were open, focused on us through the glass, but she didn’t blink.

I hit the intercom. “Alice, can you hear me?”

A pause. Then her lips moved, sluggishly, like she had to think about each motion.

“I… I can hear you.”

Her voice was slurred. Off-pitch. Too slow for a healthy motor response. Dr. Lance silently tapped a key, recording her audio latency. Almost 700 milliseconds between prompt and response.

The virus was moving up the neural ladder.

“EEG scan now,” I said.

On the secondary screen, Alice’s brain activity flared erratically — not flatlining, not even showing classic seizure patterns. It was *organized*. Like patterned interference. A kind of synthetic entrainment. Almost... *externally modulated*.

Dr. Lance stared at the scan. “These aren’t random disruptions. This thing’s not shutting her down. It’s... *reallocating*.”

“Voluntary control suspended,” came a whisper from the intercom. It was Alice again. “Something… *else* is breathing me.”

Her head tilted back. Pupils dilated, glassy. One arm lifted unnaturally — not in a tremor, but a steady, guided motion, as if pulled on strings.

I stepped back from the monitor. “She’s entering a total override.”

Lance’s face had gone pale. “There’s no fever, no systemic inflammation. The virus isn’t attacking. It’s *collaborating*.”

I looked back at the sealed vials, still on the tray. “How the hell did they make this?”

He didn’t respond. He was busy decrypting the rest of the hidden protocol, feeding it through a local neural net.

One final line emerged:

“CNS hijack complete at phase 3. Do not resuscitate post-threshold. Identity retention probability: 6%.”

Alice's breathing changed — shallower, slower, but perfectly rhythmic. Her limbs now motionless. Consciousness seemed to flicker.

Then her eyes shifted — not toward us, but toward the sequencing station.

She was looking at the virus’s data.

“Lance,” I said, barely a whisper. “She’s still in there.”

But someone — or something else — might be in there with her.

Dr. Lance was triple-checking the CNS suppression protocol, still holding out some thread of hope that we could chemically disable the virus’s control — *but I was watching the workstation*.

More specifically: Alice was watching the workstation.

She hadn’t moved. Not an inch. Still slumped in her chair, breath measured like a metronome. But then the screen at Sequencing Station B flickered — just once — and a new terminal window opened.

Command line interface. No user input.

I turned to Lance. “Did you just remote in?”

“No. That’s air-gapped. It’s not even *wired* to our main net.”

We both watched.

\> ACCESS: GRANTED > RUN /X24/PRIMORDIAL.PATH > OUTPUT: PHASE\_3\_CONFIRMED > TRACE: NULL - ENTRUST\_KEY

The terminal text blinked, then changed again:

\> ALICE\_PRESENT> TRANSMISSION INITIATED

The lab systems went dark for two full seconds. Fans shut off. The fluorescent lights above dropped into emergency low-power mode, casting everything in a cold bluish hue.

Then: *All terminals rebooted*\*\*.\*\* All *except* the one Alice was watching.

On that screen, data started pouring in — compressed packets, raw binary, unknown protocol. Not from a local source.

“She’s not interfacing,” Lance said. “She’s routing.”

“Breathing… signal…” Alice whispered from behind the glass.

I walked to the bio-pane, heart hammering. Her hands didn’t move, but her pupils were *shifting*, left to right, tracking the console refresh like a human scanner.

“She’s uploading something,” I said. “The virus is using her brain as a relay.”

Dr. Lance reached for the emergency hard kill switch on the station.

“Wait!” I said. “If we cut power now, we lose the sample. And Alice.”

His hand hovered.

“But if we don’t,” he replied, “we lose *containment*.”

The Sequencer spat out a final string — a decoded set of characters, human-readable:

“X-24: Successful host integration. Transmitting seed pattern.” “Awaiting remote activation.”

On Alice’s monitor, a new symbol appeared. Not text. A glyph — symmetrical, looping, recursive. It pulsed once. Then the display went black.

Inside the chamber, Alice blinked — the first natural motion in almost 40 minutes.

Then, she smiled. But it wasn’t hers.

A bunch of gunshots rang out from the other side of the secured door, frantic screaming followed. The silent red flashing lights in our lab seemed to go faster, an alarm now sounding facility wide.

We turned to see Alice standing near the decon door. Fleshy tendrils sprouting from her face and arms, the air of calmness shattering like our hopes. The doors malfunctioned.

The decon door *shuddered*, then hissed open—mechanically sluggish, like the system was *fighting itself*.

Alice—no, *X-24* now—stood in the threshold. Her form only *vaguely* resembled a person. The tendrils pulsing from her face weren’t random mutations. They were *structured*, jointed, flexing with purpose. One of them scraped along the metal frame of the chamber, leaving behind a faint *etching* — the same glyph that had appeared on the screen.

The hiss of the decon door hadn’t finished echoing before the main lab door — the one that was supposed to remain sealed under triple-lockdown — *screeched open*. A fault light blinked uselessly above it. Security interlocks failed, overridden.

*Containment was gone.*

Alice — or whatever had taken her name — stepped into the lab fully now, tendrils sweeping across the floor, their ends twitching like they could *smell* us. Her body wasn’t lurching or spasming anymore. It moved with *precision*.

Dr. Lance didn’t wait.

“Run!” he barked.

We bolted toward the far wall — toward the old autoclave ejection shaft near the biowaste chamber. It wasn’t meant for humans. Barely a meter wide. But it *was* unmonitored, analog, and still had power from the emergency grid.

I slammed the override panel with my fist — it sparked, struggled — then the *circular lock groaned* and began to release. Lance was yanking open the maintenance panel beneath it, revealing the chute’s interior — black, damp, *steep*.

Behind us, Alice moved.

Fast.

Her footsteps were silent — but the air *shifted* as she advanced. Her tendrils scraped metal, brushing equipment, scanning for heat.

I dove into the shaft first — slid down like a bullet, knees slamming metal rungs on the way. The *reverb* of my descent echoed up as Lance followed, just a few seconds behind.

And then — a wet *clank*.

A tendril had whipped into the chute after us, it managed to grab Dr. Lance. “NO!” he shouted before being yanked upward in the blink of an eye. “Damnit!” I stammered before hitting the bottom of the shaft.

I hit the bottom hard — ribs screaming, palms shredded from braking too late — but there was no time for pain.

Above me: silence.

Then — a *snap* of something organic, followed by a single, distant *metallic bang*. And nothing else.

“Lance!” I shouted, voice ragged, echoing upward. No reply.

My breath clouded in the cold sublevel air. I was alone.

The emergency lights here were dim, flickering orange. This place wasn’t meant for foot traffic — maintenance only, narrow walkways over coolant reservoirs and tangled piping. *No cameras. No AI systems.* Just old steel and concrete.

I staggered forward, trying to orient myself. I needed to reach a secure point — *Access Node Delta-7* was closest. If I could reach the subgrid console, I might still reroute the uplink away from Alice’s influence… and maybe, *maybe* trace Lance’s biosignature.

But as I moved, I passed something that made me stop cold.

A wall panel was open. Wires torn. Not cut — *grown through*.

Thin, translucent filaments had pushed their way into the circuit board like fungal roots — organic tendrils, interfacing with the system directly. The panel was *pulsing*, softly, in rhythm with the emergency lighting.

The glyph appeared again — burned faintly into the steel next to it.

*X-24 RECURSION INITIATEDPHASE 4 NODE INTEGRATION: PROGRESSING*

I backed away — but froze as I heard something drip behind me.

I turned.

A trail of blood led from the shute.

Still warm.

Still *wet*.

Then I saw it — Lance’s ID badge, half-melted, on the floor.

No body. Just the badge, and blood.

I knew he was dead. To backtrack would have been my downfall. I was searching the walls and desks for any information I could use when I came across a document tucked away in a folder, splayed open on the desk in front of me.

Thank God I found it. The document detailed a tunnel farther beneath the facility, used for transporting weapons and ammunition for the guards. The hatch was nearby — just a couple of rooms away.

I folded the document and slipped it into my pocket, breathing a sigh of relief before moving on. Dread and alertness compounded with every step; each one could be my last.

It didn’t take long to reach a room with a giant metal door. It had been opened — bloody handprints stained the locking mechanism. A sense of fear gripping me tightly.

I crept toward the door, anxiety taking hold. I leaned my head ever so slowly past the entry point. Inside, I froze.

A man stood below the threshold, fleshy tendrils sprouting from his forehead. They writhed — then stopped — and pointed straight at me.

Fear seized me. I bolted, sprinting into the tunnel toward the exit.

Halfway through, I heard the thump of footsteps behind me. I didn’t slow. I looked back — and my heart dropped.

It was Dr. Lance. Tendrils consumed his face. His legs — held together by those things.

I faced forward again — too late. I nearly slammed into the access elevator. I hit the button to ascend, praying it would ascend in time. Dr. Lance got ahold of my arm, slicing it with one of the long tendrils.

The elevator began to rise. Blood dripped from my arm. I didn’t have time to think — I had to kick him off. He couldn’t escape with me.

Once I hit the surface, I ran. I ran as fast and as far as I could before collapsing from exhaustion. Thankfully I happened to have been next to a road. I was told a truck driver found me.

I was rushed to the nearest hospital, which was over 30 minutes away. Doctors say it was a miracle that I was even alive. So I’m writing this to you now, I had to get this off my chest, the doctors said my arm was *infected* when I arrived.

With the skin around the cut wiggling, I had to write this. I had to tell everyone what happened, I had to inform everyone that thanks to me, we might all be doomed.
