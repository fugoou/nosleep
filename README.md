# I Found a Suit Left on the Train
I squatted on my heels while I waited for the train, taking a long drag from my vape. My phone buzzed in my pocket as Stephanie called. That was the sixth time. I’d already texted—start dinner without me—no matter how much Mum guilt-trips her. Maybe she knew that meant I wasn’t coming.


It’s not that I don’t love my family; I just crave independence more. There’s something about having nothing to fall back on that ignites my drive. Too many safety nets, and I become complacent.


At 10:30 p.m., the train would arrive and take me down the T9 Eastlake line. In an hour, I’d be in Brianna’s arms, eating her roast vegetables, sniffing sparkling wine, and pretending we were sommeliers. If they didn’t want Brianna in their home, then so be it—but I wouldn’t be there either.


When the train arrived, I watched the empty carriages fly past. The lights inside only illuminated how void of anything they were. No people. No bags. In one carriage, I saw what looked like a suit jacket hanging in a plastic dry-cleaning bag. Some unlucky sap had probably lost a good amount of money forgetting that.


I boarded the last carriage and sat in the top compartment, kicking my feet against the splotchy blue-and-yellow seat. I opened my phone, swiped away the missed calls and message notifications, and launched Block Puzzle.


As I played, I kept getting distracted by a crinkling sound, like a kid trying to quietly unwrap a candy bar. I looked around, but there was no one else in the top compartment. Still, the sound persisted, and after ten minutes of doing my best to ignore it, I pushed myself off the seat and started walking toward the lower carriage.


I paused on the steps. I hadn’t realized it when I got on, but I’d boarded the same carriage as the suit jacket. Only now did I see that it was a full suit—all dark navy wool. Expensive.


Now, I’m no thief. I could see that the dry-cleaning tag had no name or number, and a suit this nice would never see a lost-and-found bin. If it was going to wind up in someone else’s hands, why not mine?


My phone buzzed again. I left it buzzing.


The suit was attached to a handrail that dangled from the ceiling of the vestibule. I reached out to unhook it, then paused. The plastic covering was skin-tight—vacuum-sealed. There was no air in it to possibly make any crinkling sounds.


The train jostled as it rounded a corner, making the suit jacket’s arm flap out and land on my shoulder.


Where the jacket touched, my skin tightened. A sharp pain twitched in my deltoid.


I pulled back, but the jacket stayed attached.


The plastic tightened where it touched my shoulder, shrinking with a wet, sucking sound. My skin pulled with it, stretching thin and going numb, like it too was being shrink-wrapped. The pain sharpened, deep and burning, and I bit down on my tongue to keep from crying out.


I clawed at the sleeve, but my fingers slid uselessly over the plastic. Where I touched it, the vacuum-seal effect spread to my fingers, sucking them dry.


The train screeched as it slowed for the next station. The sudden deceleration broke whatever tension the suit was holding. The hanger snapped free, and I fell hard onto the floor. The plastic ripped back from my arm with a sound like masking tape.


When the doors slid open, I ran, barely feeling my feet hit the platform. The cold air burned against my arm where the plastic had been, my skin red and smooth—so tight I couldn’t even pinch it.


Behind me, the doors closed, and the train pulled away.


Through the window, I saw the suit hanging exactly where it had been when I first saw it—sealed and empty.


My phone rang in my pocket.


This time, I answered.
