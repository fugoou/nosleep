# I work in a fish and chip shop, do not eat the “Catch of the Day” (Part 1)
My first job each shift was reheating the previous night's curry sauce, a gelatinous cube of orange matter stored in an old margarine tub. Mondays meant fewer customers, it would probably be enough. I brought it back to life with a splash of water and a blast in the microwave. Next in my zombie routine was filling the batter bucket, bringing it up front, and starting the fryers. 

But something felt off. Tubs and trays weren't where I'd left them in my tiny kitchen the night before. Odd. The owner, Salvatore, rarely worked quiet shifts like this. I ducked under the narrow ceiling as I headed down the cramped steps to the shopfront. There he was, behind the main fryer. Weird.

“What’s that smell?” I asked, coming up behind him. He was frying something unusual, a strange, briny scent slipped beneath the familiar stink of hot oil. “Do we need fresh oil?”

“Oh, big man,” he replied, “didn’t see you. Nah, oil’s fine. Just a wee experiment.”

I narrowed my eyes skeptically, and he turned to catch my look. Luigi’s Fish Bar had seen plenty of experiments lately. The new pizza oven hadn't exactly driven sales as hoped. It had become more of a burden as every night without fail, minutes before close, after I'd switched it off, some drunkard would stumble in. “Aye, gie us a 8-inch spicy sweetcorn, cheers boss”

“No, trust me, this is the mutt’s nuts, this is something special,” he insisted. “I’m ahead of the pack on this one. Not even those gastro poofs in Edinburgh have heard of it yet.” I liked Sal, mostly, but his occasional homophobia reminded me how small this town was.

“I picked it up at the market this morning, a new fish, or subspecies. Blue Haddock, I think they are calling it.”

“New? What’s new about it? You don’t get new flavours of fish like Pringles.”

“Ah, fish expert now, are we? Three months battering and frying, and suddenly you're Jeremy Wade. Well, I suppose you are university educated, what was your degree again?”

“Graphic design.”

“Ah, learn a lot about fish subspecies designing graphics, do you? All I know is there’s some new fish on the market nobody’s seen before. All the trawler boys are talking about it, and I thought I'd give it a try. Special menu item, maybe people will love it. Now let’s get on with it, I’ll work the main fryer tonight, you’re on chips, so chuck some tatties in the rumbler and get the first basket on.”

The doors opened at 5 p.m., and for the first couple of hours, a small trickle of customers came and went. Single orders. On weeknights, fish suppers aren’t a big family treat but a quick dinner for the single, the busy and occasional tourist. No takers on the unknown fish special.

“Ah, Margaret, how are you? How's Harold this evening?” Sal greeted one of the elderly regulars. A wiry wee Scottish woman with a stern leathery face, hardened by a life spent by the sea.

She ordered her usual: two small fish suppers for her and her husband. “You're always ordering that, Margo. Why not try something new?” Sal laid it on thick with the charm of a used car salesman. “Oh no,” she replied, smiling politely. “Harold and I like nothing better than a nice piece of fish.”

But of course, Sal launched into his upselling patter about the new novelty catch of the day. Eventually, she relented.

He opened the fridge behind him and pulled out two fillets of Blue Haddock. Seeing them lined up on dry ice next to the regular haddock and cod only made them seem stranger. The white flesh was too clean, too flawless. They looked almost cartoonish, like fake, plastic fish. And even chilled, they were slick with a thin layer of fat, as if they were already slowly rendering in oil. It was in this oily coating that you could just catch a faint, pearlescent blue when the light hit it right.

Sal baptised the fillets in the batter bucket before dropping them into the fryer. Almost instantly, the air was filled with that strange briny scent from earlier.

Margaret breathed in deeply. Her face, sceptical at first, had softened. Her eyes widened, fixated on the sight of the frying fish.

I prepped two boxes of chips and placed the fried, golden fillets on top. Salt. Vinegar. Wrap. I handed the two paper-wrapped boxes to Margaret.

“I’ve given you two *full* portions there, love. You enjoy that,” Sal said. “Oh, you shouldn’t have, dear, we’ll never finish them. Appetite’s not the same at our age,” she chuckled.

For the next hour, no other customers came in. I spent the time folding chip boxes, topping up vinegar bottles, and cleaning the microwave. I did my best to look busy during the quiet spell, especially with Salvatore watching me. I was wiping down the counter next to the till for the second time that hour when she walked in.

Angelika’s presence—like her namesake—always seemed to illuminate the room. Her sharp features were framed by a thick cascade of dark curls, her hair in perfect contrast to the pale skin of her face and neck, lightly dusted with freckles and moles. A constellation I’d never managed to fully map, mostly because I was too afraid to stare at her for long. Like the sun. I suppose you could say I kind of liked her.

I was in my second year of high school when Angelika Kovács and her family moved to our village. Mr. Kovács, despite being from landlocked Hungary, had fallen in love with the sea and opened a boat engine repair shop, which, ten years later, now serviced the village’s entire fishing fleet.

Angelika had never quite integrated into the tight clique of our small class. She’d been deeply into paganism and goth subculture, which only made her stand out more. Since we’d both returned from university, her style had softened slightly, not full goth anymore, swapping pure black clothes and makeup for more muted tones. But still striking.

I’d had a crush on her for years in school, and now that we were both back in the village, those feelings had begun to stir again. Maybe it was that the goth girl aesthetic was popular online. Perhaps it was the allure of someone who seemed to come from a bigger, more interesting world. Either way, she stood in stark contrast to the grease-stained walls of Luigi’s Fish Bar. 

“Hey, you,” she said with a smile.

“Hey, what can I get you?”

I immediately regretted saying that. In my nervousness, I left no room for small talk. I knew I wouldn’t be able to think of anything to say, so rather than leave a silence, I defaulted to business.

“Oh. Can I get…”

I couldn’t tell if she was disappointed by the lack of small talk or if she could tell what I was thinking and was now judging me for thinking there would be small talk.

“...a fish supper and a chip roll.”

“Fish supper? I thought you were vegetarian.”

I overcorrected. Too personal, too fast. She definitely read that as me judging her.

“Yeah, still am. Hence the chip roll. The fish is for my dad.”

“Oh. Well, has he tried our new special? A new catch, it’s the latest food trend. Blue Haddock. It’s got a much richer, buttery flavour.”

I had no idea what I was saying. In an attempt to salvage some dignity and sound normal, I just sounded deranged. My sales pitch must have been convincing though, because I caught Sal listening in, he shot me a thumbs up and a sly nod.

The next five minutes were excruciating. I kept telling myself I should talk to her while the fish was frying, but I had nothing. Eventually, she took out her phone and started scrolling. I kept glancing at her in small bursts, trying not to look weird. When she looked up, I looked down, at the fryer, at the strange fish crisping and bubbling in the oil.

The briny smell was becoming overwhelming. Almost nauseating. My stomach twisted. Was it the fish? Or the shame of struggling to talk to Angelika? I couldn’t tell. I felt trapped. Sweat beaded on my forehead, and I wiped it with my forearm. Rookie mistake. The grease from the fryer on my arms and hands was now on my face. That clammy, sticky feeling would be with me all night, and I’d keep instinctively trying to wipe it off, with more greasy hands. A spiral.

“Here’s your order,” I said. “No vinegar, just salt, right?”

“Err… yeah. Thanks.”

She looked me in the eyes and gave a half-smile.

“Very smooth,” said Sal, as she stepped out the door, almost certainly still within earshot.

“You’re a natural at this. A few more sales like that, some word of mouth, and we’ll get people hooked on this new fish.”

What’s crazy to me now is how I spent the rest of that evening painfully replaying my interaction with Angelika, instead of thinking about the implications of the Blue Haddock. A new fish? What does that even mean? Is it safe to eat? Is it even legal to sell something that hasn’t been tested? Do you need a licence for this? All questions I should have been asking, instead of pining over a girl. 

To be honest, I knew deep down that was the issue. I’d spent far too many years fixated on Angelika, developing a crush instead of, well... actually getting to know her. That’s why I struggled to talk to her. I didn’t really like *her*, I liked the idea of her. Because I didn’t *know* the real her. That was the revelation I came to the next night at work. No Sal to distract me, just me, alone with my thoughts.

“Oi mate, you actually open or what?”

I was snapped out of my introspection. I hadn’t even noticed who had walked in. Robert. Another person from my past, but one I remembered far less fondly than Angelika. He wasn’t my high school bully; I’m not some nerd from an American high school movie. No, Robert was just a dickhead. He’d effortlessly flip from being your mate one minute to sadistically helping you develop a fresh insecurity the next. If Stockholm Syndrome were a friend.

Of course, he got bored with people quickly. Much to my relief, he only really gave me attention for six months, and I was glad to be rid of him. Now, if this were an American high school film, I might take comfort in him being stupid or something. Nah, Robert was smart. Good at maths and physics. Apprenticed as a civil engineer straight out of high school. Now, just five years later, he has a wife, a kid, a house, a stable job. I fry chips.

“Aye, two fish suppers and a pizza crunch.”

Good lord. A pizza crunch.

When people hear about Scotland’s deep-fried food culture, they always joke about the deep-fried Mars Bar. Truth is, that’s only ever ordered by tourists. The real epitome is the pizza crunch. Immortalised in the Scotland fans’ chant when we play Italy:

"We are gonna deep fry yer pizza, deep fry pizzas, waaaay!"

I pulled a frozen supermarket pizza from the freezer. Folded it in half and dunked it in the batter bucket. Now oozing and dripping with pale batter, I dropped the cursed calzone into the fryer.

As I was finishing Robert’s order, Margaret walked in. Two nights in a row? Odd. She approached the counter with a briskness that didn’t quite befit her years. 

“Two single fish,” she snapped. “The new fish. The blue one.”

I politely nodded, not paid enough to reflect on the weirdness. I went to the fridge to pull out the fillets. I removed the ghostly, oily Blue Haddock. Margaret’s eyes locked onto the fish in my hands. Her eyes bulged, unblinking, glassy and slightly too big for her face.

Her eyes reminded me of my pet goldfish when I was eight. They reminded me of him as I watched him dying on the floor of my bedroom. My father and I had been scooping him out of the tank while we cleaned it, and he’d jumped out of the net. His limp, flaccid body flopped on the carpet, mouth flapping open rapidly. The soft carpet absorbed the moisture from his gills while he lay there, staring up at me, in pain and anguish.

My father shouted, screaming at me as I stood frozen in terror.

“Pick it up! It’s dying, pick it up!”

I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t bring myself to touch the alien, slimy, wet creature. My eyes welled up with tears, and I ran from the room.

Dad, of course, saved the fish without a second thought. But my irrational childhood fear of fish had begun.

I reflected on that fear now, with the slimy fillets in my hand. I still couldn’t bring myself to eat fish. My go-to chippy order remains a smoked sausage. The fear had faded enough to let me cook fish for my minimum wage job, but I still can’t eat fish fingers or swim in the sea.

Focused on my frying, trying to ignore the old woman in the corner of the shop licking her lips I heard the door open again. Another customer. On a Tuesday? I looked up.

Angelika. Her deep brown eyes stared directly at me.

“I want the Blue Haddock. It smells… amazing.”
