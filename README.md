# Every Time I Wake Up, I Wake Up on the First Floor. I Sleep on the Second. No One Believes Me.


I don’t remember the first night it happened. That’s the part that bothers me most—because it must have started somewhere, right? One night where I went to bed upstairs, on the second floor like always, and woke up somehow downstairs on the couch. But memory plays tricks when your days begin to bleed together, and now it’s just become a part of my routine. I sleep upstairs. I wake up downstairs. Always on the same spot on the same couch, with the throw blanket draped perfectly over me, tucked beneath my chin like someone did it carefully, lovingly. Except I didn’t do it. And I live with my wife and son, and they both swear they haven’t touched me. But I know I’m not sleepwalking. I don’t get up during the night. I’ve even locked the bedroom door before bed. Doesn’t matter. By morning, I’m downstairs again. First floor. Same couch. Same blanket. Same sickening feeling that something isn’t right.

At first, it was almost funny. My wife, Lena, laughed it off, said I probably just woke up needing water or a snack and passed out on the couch. She said it was normal. Stress-related. “You’ve been working too hard,” she said, with that soft tone she uses when she wants me to stop asking questions. But it kept happening. Every single night. Lock the door. Wake up downstairs. I tried putting flour on the floor of the hallway. Nothing. No footsteps. I downloaded a sleep tracker app. It showed a full night’s rest, no movement. I even filmed myself sleeping—with the bedroom door in full view—and when I watched the footage, it went static around 2:14 a.m. Every night. Like clockwork. Just one second of fuzz, and then… morning.

I told Lena about that. She stopped smiling. Just looked at me, then turned away, started cleaning the kitchen like I hadn’t spoken. That’s when I started noticing other things. Little things. She started going to bed before me every night, even though she’s always been the night owl. Our son, Robbie, started drawing weird pictures—scribbles of stairs, spiral shapes, stick figures with X’s over the eyes. I asked him what they were. He shrugged and said, “The men from the bottom.” I pressed him about it, and Lena snapped. Said I was scaring him. Said I needed to drop it. But I can’t. Because now I’m starting to hear things at night.

Not the house settling or the creak of old pipes. I mean soft footsteps—wet, dragging footsteps—right outside the bedroom door. I don’t open it. I don’t dare. I just lie still and try to slow my breathing. But sometimes I swear I hear whispering, and it’s not Lena’s voice. It’s something lower. Crooked. Words I can’t understand, spoken in a rhythm that feels… ancient. And every single morning, without fail, I wake up on that damn couch like nothing happened. Except now, I feel tired. Not just sleepy. Used. Like something is wearing me, and putting me back before I notice the damage.

I tried confronting them—Lena and Robbie. I told them I knew something was wrong with this house, that I was being moved somehow, that it felt like they were in on it. Lena got real quiet. Too quiet. Then she smiled—not her normal smile, but a flat, dry one. Like her lips had to remember how to curve. “You’ve always slept down here,” she said. “Don’t you remember?” And Robbie nodded like it was a game they’d rehearsed. But I remember. I remember buying the second floor bed. I remember carrying the damn mattress up there with my brother. I remember the bruises. I remember.

Last night I did something I probably shouldn’t have. I stayed awake. Pretended to sleep, watching the door through half-lidded eyes. And right at 2:14 a.m., I heard the click. The lock turned from the outside. I didn’t move. The door creaked open slowly, and Lena stepped in. Except… I don’t think it was her. She moved wrong. Like her joints weren’t connected right. Like she was remembering how to be Lena. Her eyes were too wide. Too still. She walked over to me, gently tucked the blanket under my chin. Then she whispered, “It’s almost time.” I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t move. My body wouldn’t respond. I just lay there while she—it—left the room.

This morning, I woke up in the basement. Not the couch. The basement. There was dirt under my fingernails. My mouth tasted like salt. I don’t remember going down there. The basement door is locked with a deadbolt only accessible from the kitchen. Lena didn’t even acknowledge it. Acted like I’d just been “too tired” and fell asleep on the couch again. But I checked the security cam I’d hidden above the stairs—the one she didn’t know about. The feed was corrupted. Just like the others. Only this time, there was one still frame that remained. One image frozen at 2:14 a.m. It showed Lena and Robbie… standing at the top of the stairs, staring down. Their eyes were completely black.

Now I don’t sleep. I can’t. I’ve pushed a dresser in front of the bedroom door. I’ve nailed the windows shut. But I can still feel them. In the walls. In the stairs. Something is rehearsing inside this house. And I think I was never supposed to notice. Lena still cooks dinner. Robbie still draws. But they don’t look at me the same. They don’t blink. They don’t breathe like they used to. And every night, I hear them walking past the bedroom. Every night, the whispers get louder. I think the stairs are part of it. Some kind of spiral. A trap. A ritual. A descent. And I think… I’m already at the bottom.
