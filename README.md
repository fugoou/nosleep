# I've made it big
I had a shitty life back before I made it big.  It all went downhill when Rosa called off our engagement. It was a whole ordeal. She didn’t want to move in with me, my parents didn’t like her, and, oh, small detail – she was head over heels in love with some other guy. I guess that’s where it started.

I’d been out and about with a couple of friends. You know the types, the people you call when everything has gone to hell. It’s like sending out a bat signal, except you’re holding up an empty beer. Someone’s there to answer the call and before you know it, you’re eight shots deep and half-screaming your way through an hour-long philosophical discussion about Sesame Street.

I left my keys at the bar and went home on foot. I didn’t want the company, and I was too drunk to care. I took what I thought was a shortcut, but I ended up almost falling headfirst into a shallow river. I don’t remember much of that night, but I have this one clear memory. I was leaning against this cold black wall, crying my eyes out. I was holding my phone, watching my ex-fiancée and her newfound love posting images on Instagram. And I remember repeating to myself that, when all was said and done, I wished nothing more than to be him.

Cut me some slack, I wasn’t in a good place.

 

I was moving out of town. That was one point of contention between Rosa and I – she didn’t want to leave. Problem is, I pretty much had to. I’d been offered a great position at an import company just outside Aberdeen. Not the Scotland one. They’d been so impressed by my expansion pitch that I’d been given a promotion and a shot at pitching it for the board. Whenever I wasn’t tearing my hair out over my collapsing love life, that pitch was all I thought about. If I could close it with our board and two external clients, we’d be looking at a six-figure deal at least eight months of the year for the foreseeable future. And that was just the baseline – once we increased capacity, and if the numbers held up, we could be looking at double the growth over a five-year period.

But man, I wasn’t taking it well. Packing up my things, separating her stuff from mine… it was hard. We’d been together since middle school, and now I was closing in on 30. A breakup like that puts things into perspective and makes you question who you really are. I would forget all kinds of things. I would stand by the bathroom mirror, trying to figure out my name.

“I’m not a Mark. Not a Ken. Not a Liam…”

It’s just, when you’ve introduced yourself as Rosa and… well, you get it. It’s that ‘and’ that gets me every time. We’d always been a pair, and now it was just me. And ‘me’ was far less interesting than the ‘we’.

 

I left Rosa’s things at her place while she was at work. I had some trouble with the moving van, as they’d double-booked. Apparently, they forgot I ever called. No matter, it worked out in the end. I can’t say the move to Aberdeen was painless, but I can say that it was uneventful. That’s good enough for me. At least considering the state I was in.

Those first few days at a new place are all about firsts. First breakfast, first lunch, first dinner, first beer on the couch. I took a couple walks around the neighborhood to get a feel for the place. Mostly were folks my age with a budding family, or a couple of retired folks walking their dogs. Nothing exciting. There was a shop right around the corner where I could get myself a cheap taco sub for those days where I forgot to meal prep. It’s a charming neighborhood, and if you’re not used to small-town living, it can be a bit of a reset. Luckily, I was all about that life. I could easily see myself growing old there.

It's not the kind of town where you swing around big plans and million-dollar contracts, but my firm had an office there. They required you to work on-site for at least four out of five days, hence the move in the first place. But my pitch was to be done at a board meeting up in Winnipeg, so that’s all I had to focus on for the first month or so.

 

I’ll be the first to admit – I was overworked. I would stay up until 10pm drawing up estimates and trying to get a clear answer from our guys up in Manitoba about how many trucks we could expect if the deal went through. I was having trouble getting legal to sign off on shipping manifests, and about half a dozen little stamps of approval that I had to juggle before making the most basic of assumptions. I refused to be caught red-handed without an answer. That’s how good ideas die.

I once came home close to midnight. I took a shower and fell asleep face-first on the couch. I was still wearing my work shirt and blue tie.

That night, I had the most surreal experience. I dreamt of that night, just after Rosa broke up with me. I dreamt about the river, and that immense, black wall. Running my hand along a smooth, cold, surface. And there was a comfort in it, you know? A comfort that, it was there. It listened. And when I cried my heart out about wanting to be like the man who took my love away, well… that was honest. I felt it.

But all of that fell to the side as I dreamt about e-mails. Invoices. Quotas. Automated replies, informing me of maximum wait times. That’s what occupied the space behind my eyes.

 

The thing is, when I woke up, I checked my phone.

I’d gotten six e-mails overnight.

And somehow, I’d already responded to all of them.

 

I almost overslept. I had this uncomfortable feeling stuck with me all day. I tried to rationalize it. “Maybe I got up, answered, and forgot about it”, I thought. Or maybe I was just confused, or my e-mail provider had run some kind of update that messed up the notifications. I don’t know. Either way, it was uncomfortable to have that mundane stress seep into the back of my mind, running all the way into my dreams. That’s not a space for text messages and RSVPs.

I could feel the stress getting to me. I would look at myself in the rear-view mirror and forget the color of my eyes. Even checking pictures of myself on the phone felt unfamiliar, like I was looking at someone else. And I mean, in a way, I was. I was looking back at ‘Rosa and Me’, not at just ‘me’. Those were two *very* different people. I didn’t even *have* a selfie from after she dumped me.

But I had to keep it together. I had to make it work. Self-discovery can come later, when you’ve made it. When you’ve made it *big*.

 

All through the week, I would be getting these micro-blackouts. It would start with something cold running along my hands, sending an ache all the way up my shoulder blades, only to settle in the base of my neck. It would always make me gasp, and it made me hyper-aware of my surroundings. Like a reminder to look up. Check your surroundings. Take a deep breath. Like déja vú without the insight. And for a moment, I’d completely forget everything. Who I was. What I was doing. Why I was doing it.

Sometimes it’d last a little longer. I would find myself looking at my hand as if it was an alien. It wasn’t until I looked at my phone that I could ground myself in the here and now. I’d end up going back to my Instagram over and over, looking at whatever new picture Rosa put up. On paper, we were still friends. We’d agreed to stay friends, *officially*. Not that I wanted to, I just never could say no to her. Looking at her and her new guy would calm something in me. It didn’t matter who I was, or who I’d been. I was gonna be like that guy, someday. But better. After I made it.

I bet it looked strange to the others. The new guy checking his phone every ten minutes. Not that the others cared, I had a lot of calls coming and going, but I’m sure they thought I was slacking off. They all went home at five anyway, so there was no way for them to know I was there long after they left.

 

My dreams would grow stranger at night. It would always start with my hands on that cold wall, crying my eyes out. Then I’d hear notifications and bells, like brass horns in the distance. With my eyes closed, I would sit at an imaginary desk, writing responses and checking e-mails. I’d go through agendas, cross-referencing available times in my calendar app. And when I woke up, I would see that those things were done. It would become so frequent that I started to think it wasn’t a coincidence.

I experimented a bit. For example, I would put my phone and laptop in another room and lock my bedroom door. I couldn’t sleepwalk to another room, log in, and respond to e-mails. It was one thing to do that half-awake from your phone, but leaving the room? No. I was a heavy sleeper. But even then, I would wake up and see that green checkmark next to urgent notifications – already done.

But what could I do? I had things to get through, and the meeting was coming up. I had to finish it. I could get help once I’d gotten the ball rolling and I was cashing in a five-figure monthly commission.

 

I would see and hear things I weren’t supposed to. I’d hear notifications, despite my phone being in another room. I’d hear incoming Zoom calls despite not having my laptop. At times I would know I’d gotten a text long before ever seeing it pop up on my screen. I could just sort of feel it, you know? Like some kind of overworked, burnout sixth-sense kind of deal. I’d have a reply typed out before I even saw the icon pop up.

My boss was impressed. He was a small-town kind of guy with big city dreams, but he was solid through and through. Name’s Jerry. Had a name tag and everything. Probably the richest guy in town, but it wouldn’t be weird to miss it. He wasn’t the kind of guy to brag or throw money around, and he drove this second-hand egg-white Kia that had rust along the bumper. His wife would stop by the office to bring him lunch. I always thought it was dumb for him not to bring it himself, but I figured it was more about the ritual. They liked seeing one another, you know?

Jerry was very pleased with my work. He’d immediately sign off on it, and he’d greenlight whatever I slid his way. He did get a bit worried at times though. He didn’t like me staying late or answering e-mails on my personal time. In many ways, he was an anti-boss. He was sterner about us having proper work-life balance than volunteering for unpaid overtime.

 

I remember this one time when Jerry stopped at my desk. I was halfway through a BLT, reading an article on economic geography analysis, trying to find a source I could point to if asked about relocation specifics. Jerry put a hand on my shoulder.

“You ever take breaks?” he asked. “Ever go out for lunch? Coffee place down the street makes a mascarpone cheesecake that’s sublime.”

“Not much for cheesecake,” I admitted. “More of a sandwich guy. Lean meats.”

“I’m pretty sure they make those too.”

He smiled at me, and for a moment, I turned away from my computer. I looked up at Jerry and saw his grin freeze in place. He took a step back, and I saw his forehead wrinkle a little.

“Are you alright?” he asked. “You got something in your-“

I could feel pressure building behind my right eye. Before I could answer him, I had to rush to the bathroom.

 

My head was swimming. I puked my guts out, and I wasn’t even nauseous. Looking at myself in the mirror, I could see what he was talking about. I had this big red blot in my right eye, like a vein had burst. Poking at it, a trickle of blood ran down my finger, staining the edge of my shirt. I just tucked it tighter and poked a little more. After a couple of minutes, all the blood had drained, and something plopped out. Something small and metallic that trickled down the drain and disappeared. I never saw what it was. I was sore for the rest of the day, and I could see a little red spot on the inside of my eye, like a blood drop refusing to let go.

There were a couple of other things too. I’d see these streaks of gray in my hair, but on a closer inspection, they’d look silver. Not like in a silver fox, but as in a literal metallic sheen. It only happened once or twice, but it was enough to get a rise out of me. One time I pulled one of those hairs out, and I got a cut on my finger. Damn thing was sharper than piano wire. I tried to take a photo of it, but I couldn’t get the fingerprint reader to work. Blood does that to a screen.

All in all, there were a lot of little inconveniences. Like the world was conspiring to keep me from doing what I had to do.

 

At one point, I came home to a stranger standing on my doorstep. I thought she was there to sell me something, so I just walked right on by. It was only after I passed that she excused herself with a cough.

“Hey,” the stranger said. “You okay?”

I turned to face her. It was Rosa, but it took me a solid minute to realize it. I hadn’t seen her in a while, but it’s weird how it didn’t immediately click. There was once a time when I would’ve picked her out of a crowd of thousands, and now I couldn’t recognize her on my driveway.

“You wanna come in?” I asked, dodging the question.

“I’m not staying long,” she admitted. “Henry’s parents live up here, and I haven’t heard from you in a while, so…”

“Yeah, no, that’s fine,” I said. “Working a lot.”

“You sure you’re okay? You look a bit…”

She paused, looking me up and down. I could feel the sting behind my eye. If I closed my left eye, her whole face looked red. Blood red.

 

Before she could finish her sentence, her phone went off. I could see the blue sunflower background image. She looked down and gasped. When she looked up, her whole body language changed. There was something in her look that wasn’t there before. I blinked a couple of times to get the discomfort out, but she just turned her back to me without a word. Within seconds, she walked off.

Checking my phone, I saw that I had an outgoing text message. From me, to her, sent just seconds ago.

*“I’ll never forgive you.”*

 

Going back inside my apartment, I sat down with my phone. I felt like I was going crazy. There was no way I could’ve texted her that while standing right in front of her. Then again, maybe I could’ve sent it earlier. But I would’ve remembered that, right? So there had to be something else.

I started my laptop. I put it on a chair across the room. I turned the tab to my e-mail and waited. I’d checked my security settings a hundred times by then, there was no one but me logged into my account. It was just me, and the internet. Nothing in-between.

Still, my mind would drift. I’d think about that black wall, and the cold touch. There was no texture to it. Never once in my dream did it have a texture. It wasn’t like touching glass, brick, or sand. It was like touching *nothing*. A nothing that you couldn’t push through.

I’d wanted to be that guy. Henry, was that the name? I’d looked into my phone, and wished I was him. That’s when all this crap started.

 

A notification. One outgoing e-mail, from me, to Rosa.

*“I wish I was him.”*

I felt my heart skip a beat. I’d never sent that. I’d never asked anyone to send that. I didn’t even hold a keyboard. I stood up and pointed at the laptop, like I was trying to shame a dog that’d peed on the carpet.

“What the fuck,” I mumbled out loud. “What the *fuck*.”

And the post-it app mirrored my question perfectly, making neat little notes in the top-left corner of the screen in a cursive font.

 

I’ll be the first to admit, I wasn’t dealing with it very well. I turned that laptop from office equipment to garbage with three kicks and a throw. It left a dent on my newly plastered wall, almost knocking down my framed degree. When I still heard notifications from it, I dragged the pieces into the bathroom and ran them under a cold tap. When that didn’t work I grabbed my phone and threw it from the balcony. I heard it bounce off the neighbor’s garage.

For a moment I stood there, heart racing and fingers ice cold. Everything was off. I turned off every light so I wouldn’t hear any humming electronics. I stood there with my hands out, counting my breaths. Of course I’d overreacted. I wasn’t myself. I hadn’t been for some time.

Then, I heard the notification again. Not from the laptop. Not from the phone. Not from anywhere.

But I heard it.

Was it still sending e-mails?

 

As the big day grew closer, I was as ready as could be. I got a new laptop, and I was ready to go. All files were a click away. I had all the necessary numbers and e-mails, I’d triple-checked every relevant document, printed out all the handouts, and prepped for a perfect 1pm to 3pm timeslot. My shirt and jacket were pressed and folded. Jerry got us flights and paid for the hotel rooms. Six more folks from the office joined. They were all excited to see where this might lead. If I pulled it off, we could all be looking at a raise. We could make it big together.

We made it through TSA without a hitch. Jerry took a nap outside the gate as we waited for our boarding group to get called. Economy plus isn’t fancy, but Jerry likes to keep things real and grounded. Company outing to Canada isn’t big enough news for first class.

As the plane began to rise, I felt something awful. It was like a static shimmer behind my eyes, with this groaning noise growing louder and louder. I could feel the ice of that black wall on my hands, growing so cold my fingertips turned white. I had to get out of my seat and hurry to the bathroom, climbing over two other passengers as I went.

I locked the flimsy door, pressing my hands against my ears. These little sounds inside my head kept growing and distorting, like I was losing some kind of signal. I could feel a part of me stretching like a rubber band, agonizing me with the possibility of a sudden snap.

I looked in the bathroom mirror as the swelling blood vessel in my right eye turn more and more bloated.

Then something burst, spraying the bathroom mirror in a long line of dark, brownish, red.

 

I was sitting on the floor, dry heaving, for at least ten minutes. When I finally opened my right eye, I could see this red pulse going off and on, off and on. But it wasn’t *my* pulse. It was a different beat. Like something playing along with another system of mine.

The thought crossed my mind that Henry wouldn’t have this kind of problem. He wouldn’t *try* to make it big. He would be happy in that shitty little town with Rosa, never pushing for something better. And maybe I’d been an idiot for trying, but that wasn’t going to stop me. She should’ve stood by me, thick and thin. That was the *promise*.

I got up, dusted off my pants, and wiped the mirror clean. My right eye was looking grim. It had a gray hue to it, and the pupil was almost completely black. And if I looked real close, I could see that strange red pulse in the back.

Like a little blinking light, telling me there were unread notifications waiting.

 

By the time we landed, Jerry pulled me aside before we could get our bags. He put his hands on my shoulders and looked me in the eye. He was concerned – I could tell.

“You don’t look all there,” he said. “You sure you’re up for this?”

“I can’t miss it,” I said. “I’ll be fine.”

“I know you can’t miss it, that’s why I’m asking. If you’re sick, be sick. But don’t go into that meeting doing something you shouldn’t. We got a lot riding on this.”

“I got this, Jerry. I promise.”

He looked me in the eyes for a couple of seconds, letting his stare linger on my right one a little longer. He shook his head and took a deep breath.

“I’m trusting you. I really am.”

Another pat, and we were off.

 

We got our bags and took an uber. We had a couple of hours left until the meeting, and some of the big wigs were having brunch together before we started. That gave me at least three hours to get my affairs in order. Jerry handed me the keys to the kingdom and reassured me just how much trust he was putting in me and my work. I assured him I’d be fine.

We had rented out a couple of rooms in the hotel we were staying at. Fancy place with signature napkins and that thicker kind of paper in their free notebooks. The kind of place where you’re expected to keep the complimentary slippers in your room. I caught a glimpse of the associates as they shook hands with Jerry and hurried off to some restaurant downtown, while I went ahead to get set up.

It took me no more than a couple of minutes. I put up my new laptop, plugged it in, and clicked to put in the password. I blinked a couple of times as a drop of blood poked out of my eye, dripping between the K and the L key. Not much I could do about that.

I don’t remember putting the password in. I was going to, but it’s as if it happened by itself. I figured it was another micro-blackout. I grasped the side of the laptop tight, biting my lower lip.

“Get your *shit* together,” I wheezed. “Get your fucking *shit* together.”

 

I watched the clock count down. With just minutes left to spare, and after triple-checking that my phone was muted, I heard a notification. Again, not from my laptop. Not from my phone either. I knew it was there, but I couldn’t allow myself to read it.

But somehow, I knew what it said.

I could see it play out in my mind’s eye. Text messages. E-mails. All from me, to Rosa. Little thoughts that got caught up here and there, telling here little intrusive things. Things like how I missed her, how I wished things had been different, how I wish I had stayed a little longer. All from my accounts, but not from me. I’d never written that. Thought them, yes, but never written. And yet, I knew they’d been sent.

The moment the door opened, a reply played in the red of my right eye.

*“I’m blocking you. I’m glad Henry is nothing like you.”*

 

When Jerry walked in, I did my best to put on a smile. Three associates followed him, shaking my hand as they went along. I couldn’t help but notice a little hesitation as they looked at me. Jerry had that same look.

“Got some red on you,” the last associate mentioned, pointing at my shirt. “Don’t work yourself too hard now, you hear?”

I let out a courtesy laugh and took my place at the front of the room. I made a short introduction, telling them about my work at the firm, and an overview of the proposal we were about to discuss. It took a couple of minutes, and I could feel there was a solid flow. It sounded practiced, but not rehearsed. Like I could throw a couple of words in here and there without losing the rhythm. I was good.

As a final flair from the introductory screen, I was going to read aloud the official name of the proposal, the name of those associated with it, and my own name – the author. And it went flawless, all the way up to that last line.

My name had been removed from the slide.

 

I blanked *completely*. My hand shook as I thought about pressing past it, but I’d paused too long to not make it awkward.

The name wasn’t Henry, I knew that much. I’m not a Henry. Not a Ken. Not a Liam.

But what stuck with me was not fumbling for a name to give them, but that helpless frustration boiling in my chest. She blocked me just for telling the truth? For telling it like it was? And after all we’d done together, she was happy with Henry being *nothing* like me.

She was *happy* about that. I couldn’t accept that.

 

Then I heard something. A long, drawn-out electric current. Like a rattlesnake recorded through a tin can phone.

*“I can’t accept that.”*

The words drawled out of the speaker like a stillbirth collapsing through the airwaves. Ugly, and dead by the time they hit my ears. I turned to the associates, only to see their faces scrunch up in disgust.

“*I didn’t say that*” the voice continued, torturing the laptop and the conference Bluetooth speakers all at once. “*I’m not saying this!”*

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. Instead, the raw syllables reflected all through the room. In every phone. In every laptop. In every hearing aid.

 

I could hear notifications going off. E-mails being sent. Text messages. Social media posts. I could hear words that I wasn’t going to say echo through the speaker, like my mind was bleeding.

“*Fuck this*,” the voice growled. “*How can these idiots not see that this is a done deal? Why do I have to convince them to get rich?*”

I waved my arms, pointed at my mouth, but nothing was coming out. They didn’t know how to react. One of them got up and backed up against the wall. Jerry almost fell out of his chair. Another had to throw his hearing aid across the room, moaning in pain and clutching his head.

My hands grew so cold that they burned me. As I opened my mouth to scream, the smarthome lamps started to flicker and burn. Out of the corridors, I could hear mechanical screeching as plastic sockets contorted against uncontrolled, melting heat. Within seconds, the fire alarm set off, but the sound was warped and sickly.

It was every man for themselves. The red in my right eye turned black, and moments later, I was left standing on my own as the emergency lights flashed. I couldn’t tell if my whole world had turned red, or if it was just me.

I could hear the feed in my mind. E-mails. Pictures. Photos. Innermost thoughts and impulses, broadcast over and over and over. There was no filter. Just send, send, send. Hate. Love. Sex. Violence.

No one stopped me when I walked out. My tears stained the carpet in the lobby. I left the laptop and the phone on the conference desk. I didn’t need them – I could hear my responses from here. Little voices in the back of my mind, asking what the hell was wrong with me. Distant aunts and uncles asking how I could post things this crude and awful publicly. Jerry tried to reach me six times before I got to the parking lot. I just kept walking.

 

You know what’s funny? I think back on that night with the cold black wall. And you know, I don’t think it tricked me. I was looking at my *phone*, and I wanted to be like the guy on the *screen*. But I wasn’t looking at a *guy*. I was looking at photons, computer chips, silicone plastic and micro-wiring. I was looking at a means of communication, a way to talk without speaking. A way to say what I want without ever opening my mouth.

Maybe that’s what it thought I wanted to be. Not Henry, but the screen he was on.

I made it to a new place. I lost my nails after a couple of days. I started drinking sugar water instead of eating. I poured up ice-cold water and lay in the tub, trying to keep myself cool. I keep running hot when there’s a lot going on.

 

I don’t even know all the things that’ve happened since. I think my hair fell out. My skin feels dry and hard, and it crackles when I move. But it’s beautiful here. I can go anywhere, see anything. I can tap into things you can’t even imagine. It’s like rushing down a hundred highways at once, all on my own. I can hear people arguing like I’m not in the room. I can see their dogs snoozing at the end of their beds through their security cameras. I can post on Reddit, using any account I could ever want.

And yes, I see Rosa too. But that’s fine. I don’t care to look. She can have her Henry, I got something far better. I got all the time and money I could ever reach for, and she won’t have any of it. Not a fucking dime.

I’ve made it big. I’ve made it so big, and I’m gonna get bigger.

You’ll see.
